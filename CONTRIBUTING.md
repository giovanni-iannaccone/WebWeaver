## üë®‚Äçüíª Development guidelines
- **Modularity**: functions should be small and focused on a single responsibility
- **Separation of Concerns**: maintain clear separation between business logic and utility functions
- **Error Handling**: handle errors gracefully. All errors should be logged using the utilities provided
- **Documentation**: add comments to explain complex logic, particularly when working with external libraries

## üé® Code style
- **Naming**: use camelCase for function and variables names
- **Clarity and Consistency**: keep variable and function names descriptive, avoid unnecessary abbreviations
- **Types**: specify varibles types in declaration where it doesn't look redoundaunt
- **Error Handling**: check all errors explicitly, avoid ignoring errors
- **Formatting**: ensure your code is properly formatted using gofmt
- **Comments**: add a one-line comment before every function to explain what will do
- **Imports**: organize imports into three sections:
    1. Standard library packages
    2. Internal project packages
    3. External libraries

Ensure all your tests pass before submitting a PR, update documentation if your changes affect the program's behaviour

These guidelines are designed to keep the codebase readable, maintainable, and consistent, even when multiple developers contribute. Following a common style helps reduce errors and makes the code easier to understand for others in the team.
If you'd like to add more specific guidelines or have questions, feel free to ask!
