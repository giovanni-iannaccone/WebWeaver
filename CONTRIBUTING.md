# üë®‚Äçüíª Development guidelines
- **Modularity**: functions should be small and focused on a single responsibility
- **Separation of Concerns**: maintain clear separation between business logic and utility functions
- **Error Handling**: handle errors gracefully. All errors should be logged using the utilities provided
- **Documentation**: add comments to explain complex logic, particularly when working with external libraries

# üé® Code style
- **Function naming**: use camelCase for function names
- **Error Handling**: check all errors explicitly, avoid ignoring errors
- **Formatting**: ensure your code is properly formatted using gofmt
- **Imports**: organize imports into three sections:
1. Standard library packages
2. Internal project packages
3. External libraries

Ensure all your tests pass before submitting a PR, update documentation if your changes affect the program's behaviour
